FIREWORKS_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
# Set your Fireworks account slug, NOT an email. Examples:
#   my-team
#   research-lab
# You may also set a full resource like accounts/my-team; the scripts will extract the slug.
# NOTE: the literal slug "fireworks" is reserved by Fireworks and will 403. Use your team slug instead.
# For offline smoke runs, leave the slug unset and pass --dry_run to scripts.run_all.
