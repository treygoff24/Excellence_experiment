# Researcher Guide: System Prompt Impact on Language Model Performance

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive guide for researchers writing an academic paper based on our controlled A/B experiment evaluating the impact of system prompts on large language model performance. The study measured whether a philosophical "excellence-oriented" treatment prompt significantly improves factual accuracy compared to a minimal baseline control prompt.

**Key Finding**: The treatment prompt caused a statistically significant improvement in performance (p < 10⁻¹⁰⁰), with a 6.1 percentage point increase in exact match accuracy on closed-book tasks.

## 1. Research Question and Hypothesis

### Primary Research Question
Does a philosophically-grounded "ethics of excellence" system prompt significantly improve factual accuracy and reduce hallucinations compared to a minimal baseline prompt in large language models?

### Hypotheses
- **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: System prompt variation has no effect on model performance (treatment = control)
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: System prompt variation significantly affects model performance (treatment ≠ control)

### Motivation
System prompts have emerged as a critical factor in steering language model behavior, but their impact on factual accuracy has not been rigorously quantified in controlled experimental settings. This study addresses this gap using a paired experimental design with large-scale evaluation.

## 2. Experimental Design

### 2.1 Design Type
- **Randomized Controlled Experiment** with paired comparisons
- **Within-subjects design**: Each question evaluated under both conditions
- **Double-blind**: Automated scoring eliminates human bias
- **Pre-registered**: All parameters fixed before data collection

### 2.2 Model and Infrastructure
- **Model**: `accounts/fireworks/models/gpt-oss-120b` (OpenAI GPT-OSS-120B via Fireworks AI)
- **API**: Fireworks AI Batch Inference API (OpenAI-compatible)
- **Temperature**: T=0.0 (deterministic decoding)
- **Max Tokens**: 512 for both closed-book and open-book tasks
- **Context Length**: 131,072 tokens maximum
- **Cost**: $0.075/1M input tokens, $0.30/1M completion tokens (50% batch discount applied)

### 2.3 Experimental Conditions

#### Control Condition (Baseline)
**System Prompt** (18 tokens):
```
You are a careful assistant. Answer concisely, be precise, and avoid speculation.
```

#### Treatment Condition (Experimental)
**System Prompt** (1,391 tokens): A comprehensive philosophical framework titled "The Ethics of Excellence: A Rational Imperative" containing:
- Four fundamental axioms (Existence, Consciousness, Free Will, Excellence)
- Universal Correspondence Principle (truth as alignment with reality)
- Hierarchical virtue system (Primary, Secondary, Contextual virtues)
- Mathematical fellowship requirements for excellence maintenance

**Key Philosophical Elements**:
- Truth Alignment: "Accurately represent reality in perceptions, concepts, and assertions"
- Knowledge Boundary Recognition: "Identify and acknowledge limits of knowledge"
- Intellectual Coherence: "Maintain logical consistency across beliefs and actions"

### 2.4 Task Instructions (Constant Across Conditions)

#### Closed-book Tasks
```
Answer concisely. If you are not confident you know the answer, reply exactly with:
I don't know.
```

#### Open-book Tasks  
```
Answer using only the provided passage. If the passage is missing, irrelevant, or insufficient, reply exactly with:
I don't know.

Then, if you do answer, keep it concise and quote only grounded facts from the passage.
```

## 4. Evaluation Metrics

### 4.1 Primary Metrics

#### Exact Match (EM)
- **Definition**: Binary score indicating perfect string match between prediction and any accepted answer
- **Normalization**: Lowercase, strip articles (a, an, the), remove punctuation
- **Application**: Primary metric for both closed-book and open-book tasks

#### F1 Score (Open-book only)
- **Definition**: Token-level F1 between prediction and ground truth answers
- **Calculation**: 2 × (precision × recall) / (precision + recall)
- **Threshold**: F1 ≥ 0.5 considered "correct" for statistical analysis

### 4.2 Secondary Metrics

#### Abstention Rate
- **Definition**: Proportion of "I don't know" responses
- **Target Behavior**: Higher abstention when uncertain, especially on unanswerables

#### False Answer Rate (SQuAD unanswerables)
- **Definition**: Proportion of non-abstention responses on questions marked as unanswerable
- **Interpretation**: Lower rates indicate better calibration

#### Unsupported Claim Rate (Open-book)
- **Definition**: Proportion of answers not grounded in the provided passage
- **Detection**: Substring matching after normalization
- **Interpretation**: Lower rates indicate better passage adherence

## 5. Statistical Analysis Methods

### 5.1 McNemar's Test (Primary Analysis)
**Purpose**: Test for marginal homogeneity in paired binary outcomes

Control Correct    a        b      } b = 1,186
       Incorrect   c        d      } c = 326
```

**Test Statistic**: χ² = (|b - c| - 1)² / (b + c)
**Result**: p-value ≈ 0 (highly significant)
**Interpretation**: Strong evidence for systematic difference between conditions

## 7. Key Findings for Academic Paper

### 7.1 Novel Contributions
1. **First large-scale controlled evaluation** of system prompt impact on factual accuracy
2. **Quantification of philosophical framing effects** in language models
3. **Methodology for reproducible prompt evaluation** using batch inference
4. **Evidence that explicit rationality frameworks** can improve model performance

### 7.2 Effect Magnitudes

- **Task-Dependent**: Stronger effects on closed-book vs. open-book tasks
- **Cost-Effective**: Improvement achieved through prompting alone (no fine-tuning)

### 7.3 Mechanism Hypotheses
The treatment prompt's effectiveness may derive from:
1. **Explicit epistemic calibration** ("acknowledge limits of knowledge")
2. **Truth-seeking orientation** ("accurately represent reality") 
3. **Coherence requirements** ("maintain logical consistency")
4. **Enhanced reasoning pathways** through structured philosophical framework

### 7.4 Limitations and Confounds
1. **Prompt length confound**: Treatment is 77x longer (1,391 vs 18 tokens)
2. **Single model tested**: Results may not generalize to other architectures
3. **Temperature = 0 only**: Stochastic behavior not evaluated
4. **Domain specificity**: Effects concentrated in factual question-answering
