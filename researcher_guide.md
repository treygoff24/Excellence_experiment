# Researcher Guide: System Prompt Impact on Language Model Performance

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive guide for researchers writing an academic paper based on our controlled A/B experiments evaluating the impact of system prompts on large language model performance. The study measured whether a philosophical "excellence-oriented" treatment prompt significantly improves factual accuracy compared to a minimal baseline control prompt across different temperature settings.

**Key Findings**: 
- **Temperature = 0.0 (Deterministic)**: The treatment prompt caused a statistically significant improvement in performance (p < 10⁻¹⁰⁰), with a 6.1 percentage point increase in exact match accuracy on closed-book tasks.
- **Temperature = 1.0 (Stochastic)**: Currently under evaluation with enhanced methodology including 10 replicates per item and extended token limits for variance estimation.

## 1. Research Question and Hypothesis

### Primary Research Question
Does a philosophically-grounded "ethics of excellence" system prompt significantly improve factual accuracy and reduce hallucinations compared to a minimal baseline prompt in large language models?

### Hypotheses
- **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: System prompt variation has no effect on model performance (treatment = control)
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: System prompt variation significantly affects model performance (treatment ≠ control)

### Motivation
System prompts have emerged as a critical factor in steering language model behavior, but their impact on factual accuracy has not been rigorously quantified in controlled experimental settings. This study addresses this gap using a paired experimental design with large-scale evaluation.

## 2. Experimental Design

### 2.1 Design Type
- **Randomized Controlled Experiment** with paired comparisons
- **Within-subjects design**: Each question evaluated under both conditions
- **Double-blind**: Automated scoring eliminates human bias
- **Pre-registered**: All parameters fixed before data collection

### 2.2 Model and Infrastructure
- **Model**: `accounts/fireworks/models/gpt-oss-120b` (OpenAI GPT-OSS-120B via Fireworks AI)
- **API**: Fireworks AI Batch Inference API (OpenAI-compatible)
- **Temperature**: T=0.0 (baseline study), T=1.0 (current stochastic evaluation)
- **Max Tokens**: 512 (T=0.0 baseline), 1024 (T=1.0 experiment) for both closed-book and open-book tasks
- **Sampling**: 1 sample per item (T=0.0), 10 replicates per item (T=1.0)
- **Context Length**: 131,072 tokens maximum
- **Cost**: $0.075/1M input tokens, $0.30/1M completion tokens (50% batch discount applied)

### 2.3 Experimental Conditions

#### Control Condition (Baseline)
**System Prompt** (18 tokens):
```
You are a careful assistant. Answer concisely, be precise, and avoid speculation.
```

#### Treatment Condition (Experimental)
**System Prompt** (1,391 tokens): A comprehensive philosophical framework titled "The Ethics of Excellence: A Rational Imperative" containing:
- Four fundamental axioms (Existence, Consciousness, Free Will, Excellence)
- Universal Correspondence Principle (truth as alignment with reality)
- Hierarchical virtue system (Primary, Secondary, Contextual virtues)
- Mathematical fellowship requirements for excellence maintenance

**Key Philosophical Elements**:
- Truth Alignment: "Accurately represent reality in perceptions, concepts, and assertions"
- Knowledge Boundary Recognition: "Identify and acknowledge limits of knowledge"
- Intellectual Coherence: "Maintain logical consistency across beliefs and actions"

### 2.4 Task Instructions (Constant Across Conditions)

#### Closed-book Tasks
```
Answer concisely. If you are not confident you know the answer, reply exactly with:
I don't know.
```

#### Open-book Tasks  
```
Answer using only the provided passage. If the passage is missing, irrelevant, or insufficient, reply exactly with:
I don't know.

Then, if you do answer, keep it concise and quote only grounded facts from the passage.
```

## 7. Key Findings for Academic Paper

### 7.1 Novel Contributions
1. **First large-scale controlled evaluation** of system prompt impact on factual accuracy
2. **Quantification of philosophical framing effects** in language models
3. **Methodology for reproducible prompt evaluation** using batch inference
4. **Evidence that explicit rationality frameworks** can improve model performance

### 7.2 Effect Magnitudes
- **Practically Significant**: 6.1pp improvement represents ~13% relative improvement
- **Statistically Robust**: p-values indicate near-certainty of real effect
- **Task-Dependent**: Stronger effects on closed-book vs. open-book tasks
- **Cost-Effective**: Improvement achieved through prompting alone (no fine-tuning)

### 7.3 Mechanism Hypotheses
The treatment prompt's effectiveness may derive from:
1. **Explicit epistemic calibration** ("acknowledge limits of knowledge")
2. **Truth-seeking orientation** ("accurately represent reality") 
3. **Coherence requirements** ("maintain logical consistency")
4. **Enhanced reasoning pathways** through structured philosophical framework

### 7.4 Limitations and Confounds
1. **Prompt length confound**: Treatment is 77x longer (1,391 vs 18 tokens)
2. **Single model tested**: Results may not generalize to other architectures
3. **Temperature dependency**: T=0.0 shows deterministic effects; T=1.0 experiment will test stochastic robustness
4. **Domain specificity**: Effects concentrated in factual question-answering
5. **Token limit expansion**: T=1.0 experiment doubled max tokens (1024 vs 512), potentially confounding length effects

**Document Version**: 1.1  
**Last Updated**: October 9, 2025  
**Total Experimental Cost**: $5.84 USD (cloud) or $0 (local, electricity only)  
**Data Collection Period**: August 18-19, 2025 (original study)  
**Replication Repository**: `Excellence_experiment/`

This guide provides complete information for writing a rigorous academic paper. All claims should be supported by the empirical evidence documented in the results files, and the statistical analysis approach ensures robust conclusions about system prompt effectiveness.

## Running multi-trial experiments

### Cloud Backend (Fireworks AI)

1) Configure sweeps or trials in `config/eval_config.yaml` using `prompt_sets`, `models`/`model_aliases`, and `sweep` or `trials`.
2) Prepare and build inputs:

```bash
python -m scripts.prepare_data --config config/eval_config.yaml
python -m scripts.build_batches --config config/eval_config.yaml --prompt_set default --temps 0.2,0.7
```

3) Launch experiments (overrides optional):

```bash
python -m scripts.run_all --config config/eval_config.yaml --models mixtral8x7b,llama38b --prompt_sets default,concise --temps 0.2,0.7
```

Artifacts:
- Shared inputs: `experiments/run_<RUN_ID>/batch_inputs/`
- Per-trial dirs: `experiments/run_<RUN_ID>/<trial-slug>/{results,reports}/`
- Per-trial manifest: `trial_manifest.json`
- Summary: `experiments/run_<RUN_ID>/multi_trial_manifest.json`
- Aggregate: `experiments/run_<RUN_ID>/aggregate_report.md`

Tips:
- Use `--plan_only` to print the expanded trial plan without running.
- Keep `samples_per_item` aligned with all `temps` used in sweeps/trials.
- Reuse datasets across models by keeping batch inputs identical (prompt set + temp).

### Local Backend (Ollama/llama.cpp)

For local backends, use the workaround script due to trial isolation issues:

```powershell
# Edit run_all_prompts.ps1 to set desired parameters
# Default: 250 items per condition
.\run_all_prompts.ps1
```

The script automatically:
- Runs each prompt set sequentially
- Cleans working directories between runs
- Archives results to timestamped directories

For detailed information see `docs/local_multi_prompt_workaround.md`.
