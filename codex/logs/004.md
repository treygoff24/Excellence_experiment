2025-09-08T15:12:00Z Started Ticket 004: Smoke interrupts, unit tests, and docs for resume.
2025-09-08T15:12:20Z Created branch feat/gpt5-004-testing-smoke-interrupts-and-docs from feat/gpt5-003-resume-cli-migration-and-tooling.
2025-09-08T15:16:30Z Extended scripts/smoke_orchestration.py: added --dry_run passthrough, STOP injection points (post_build|pre_submit|pre_poll|pre_parse), resume pass, and duplicate-id checks.
2025-09-08T15:20:10Z Added pytest suite: tests/test_stop_token.py, tests/test_manifest_upgrade.py, tests/test_stage_status_idempotency.py, tests/test_gating_plan_only.py; added tests/conftest.py and pytest.ini.
2025-09-08T15:22:10Z Updated Makefile: make smoke now runs dry-run orchestration; added make plan.
2025-09-08T15:25:30Z Updated README.md and EXPERIMENT_WORKFLOW.md with gating flags, plan-only, STOP semantics, and state/manifest locations.

Validation
- Ran: pytest -q → all tests passed (5 dots)
- Ran: python -m scripts.smoke_orchestration --n 3 --prompt_set operational_only --dry_run → completed end-to-end, verified predictions.csv present and custom_id uniqueness; artifacts auto-cleaned.

Notes
- Optional deps (scipy/statsmodels) absent; orchestrator wrote empty significance or skipped optional analyses without failing.
- STOP injection is supported; in dry-run, stages may gate quickly. Use --stop_point post_build|pre_submit|pre_parse for explicit testing.
