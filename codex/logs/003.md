2025-09-08T13:10:00Z Started Ticket 003: Resume CLI, migration, and tooling.
2025-09-08T13:11:00Z Created branch feat/gpt5-003-resume-cli-migration-and-tooling from feat/gpt5-002-manifest-v2-idempotency-and-repair.
2025-09-08T13:18:00Z Added scripts/resume_run.py with config discovery, drift checks, migration, and dispatch to run_all.
2025-09-08T13:24:00Z Updated scripts/list_runs.py to read run_state.json, display overall status, migrated flag, and phase breakdown.
2025-09-08T13:28:00Z Updated scripts/compare_runs.py with STATE & COMPATIBILITY section (config hash equality and manifest schema versions).
2025-09-08T13:31:00Z Updated scripts/archive_run.py to gate archiving by run_state (require completed or --allow_incomplete) and enrich archive_manifest with state.
2025-09-08T13:33:00Z Ready for smoke validation of resume + migration on existing runs.

Smoke validation
- Ran: python -m scripts.list_runs -v
- Ran: python -m scripts.compare_runs --run1 run_r20250902214642 --run2 run_r20250902214910 --experiments_dir experiments
- Ran (migration + minimal resume): python -m scripts.resume_run --run_id r20250902214642 --only_step report
  - Observed: synthesized experiments/run_r20250902214642/run_state.json (migrated: true), phases populated based on artifacts.
  - run_all executed only report-related gating; optional extras warned about missing scipy but did not fail.
