# Ticket 125 — Troubleshooting Playbook (Windows Local)

Date: 2025-09-09

Summary
- Added a concise troubleshooting guide for common Windows local run failures.
- Created minimal Windows guide page and linked the troubleshooting playbook from it.

Changes
- New: `docs/troubleshooting_windows_local.md`
- New: `docs/windows.md` (links to the troubleshooting doc; to be expanded by Windows docs tickets)

Acceptance Checks
- Playbook includes exact commands and expected checks:
  - Ollama server start + `/api/tags` verification commands (PowerShell + curl).
  - OOM remediation steps (context, quantization, concurrency, close GPU apps).
  - Guidance for `finish_reason=length` (increase `max_new_tokens`, configure `stop`).
  - Parser mismatch remediation (ensure `custom_id` echoed; parse via `fireworks.parse_results`; mention Ticket 114 validation).
  - Performance knobs for scoring with `MKL_NUM_THREADS/OMP_NUM_THREADS/NUMEXPR_MAX_THREADS=8` and phased execution.
- Linked from `docs/windows.md` per acceptance criteria.

Notes
- Kept instructions deterministic and copy‑pasteable for PowerShell.
- Did not alter code paths; documentation only.
