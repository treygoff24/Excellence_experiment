Ticket 110 — Windows bootstrap and developer ergonomics

Date: 2025-09-09

Summary
- Added PowerShell bootstrap and task runner for Windows.
- Mirrored Makefile phases with idempotent, local-only scripts.
- Authored initial Windows setup documentation.

Files
- tools/bootstrap.ps1 — Creates .venv via `py -3.11`, upgrades pip, installs requirements.
- tools/tasks.ps1 — Runs tasks: Data, Build, Eval, Parse, Score, Stats, Report, Plan, Smoke. Supports -List and -WhatIf.
- docs/windows.md — Setup steps and usage examples.

Validation
- Verified commands match Makefile targets exactly.
- Ensured scripts require no global PATH changes and fail clearly if `py -3.11` is missing.
- WhatIf mode prints underlying command strings and exits 0.

Next
- In ticket 121, expand Windows documentation (troubleshooting, firectl usage, orchestration flags).
