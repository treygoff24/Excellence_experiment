# Windows Guide (Local Runs)

This guide will aggregate Windows‑specific setup and workflows for running evaluations locally with Ollama or llama.cpp.

- Quick start: use `tools/bootstrap.ps1` (see planning docs) to create and activate a virtualenv, then prefer `make smoke` to validate basics.
- Troubleshooting: see Troubleshooting — Windows Local Runs for fast fixes and common issues:
  - docs/troubleshooting_windows_local.md

Additional content (setup, models, example configs) will be expanded in related tickets.
